# DGA Resource Center

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for kb.dga.or.th.

We build this website using Astro and its official documentation framework, [![Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:
    * Using npm: npm install
    * Using yarn: yarn install
4. Start the development server:
    * Using npm: npm run dev
    * Using yarn: yarn dev This will start the development server at http://localhost:4321/. Â  

### Building for Production:

Build the project for production:
* Using npm: npm run build
* Using yarn: yarn build This will create an optimized production build in the dist folder.

### Content Structure

This project uses the following folder structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (You are here!)
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs  (Astro configuration file)
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules  (Dependency folder)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json  (Project dependencies and scripts)
â”œâ”€â”€ public  (Static assets like favicons)
â””â”€â”€ src  (Project source code)
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  (Folder for images)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ files/   (Folder for files)
    â”œâ”€â”€ content  (Contains documentation content)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs  (Markdown files for documentation pages)
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ service  (Subfolder for each service)
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.mdx  (Homepage content)
    â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json  (TypeScript configuration file)
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
